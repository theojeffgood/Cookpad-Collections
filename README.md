As this is a beta release, it's missing a few things. For example:

- Empty States when data fails to load (e.g. bad network connection)
- User-friendly messaging for missing images / data (e.g. due to unclean dataset)
- Handling some special characters that appear in user-generated data
- Resolve auto-layout warnings

Low hanging fruit for future enhancements: 

- Dark mode support
- Landscape mode support
- Optimize for more screen sizes (smaller iPhones. larger iPads)
- Links to recipe step images
